# AutoML-Stock-Market-Prediction

This repository contains a project focused on predicting stock market prices using advanced machine learning techniques and AutoML (auto-sklearn). The main objective is to automate the model selection and hyperparameter tuning processes to improve prediction accuracy in the volatile stock market.

## Project Overview

The project strategy involves leveraging the auto-sklearn library to automatically identify the best model and hyperparameters for the given stock market dataset. Instead of manual model iteration and tuning, this approach expedites the process and aims to yield more accurate predictions.

## Intended Audience

This solution is designed for:
- Stock market analysts
- Financial institutions
- Hedge funds
- Individual traders
- Anyone looking to leverage machine learning for more informed investment decisions

## Challenges

Some of the challenges faced in this project include:
- Cleaning and preprocessing stock market data
- Dealing with the volatile nature of stock prices
- Avoiding overfitting or underfitting of models
- Selecting appropriate features for the model
- Achieving satisfactory prediction accuracy

## Pipeline Instructions

1. **Data Loading:** Load the stock market datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it's suitable for modeling.
3. **Model Training:** Use auto-sklearn to train the model on the training dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model on the test dataset using various metrics.
5. **Visualization:** Visualize the predictions against the actual stock prices.
